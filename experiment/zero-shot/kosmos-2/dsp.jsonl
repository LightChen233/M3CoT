The rainfall occurs in the form of heavy rainfall, accompanied by strong winds. The temperature in the tropical rainforest ranges from a tropical high of around 30°C to a tropical low of around 20°C. The average annual temperature is around 18°C, and the average annual rainfall is around 200 mm. Subtropical meditreanean climate: Subtropical climates are characterized by relatively cool temperatures, with average temperatures ranging from a low of about 10°C in the tropics to a high of about 30° C in the temperate zones. The climate is characterized primarily by a dry season, with the average temperature being around 10° C. The annual rainfall in the subtropics is typically around 200mm, and it is generally less than 100mm in the more temperate zones of the world. Temperate maritime climate: Temperate climates typically have a relatively cool climate, with temperatures ranging between a low around 10 °C in tropical regions and a high around 30 °C. Average annual temperatures are around 15 °C, with an average annual precipitation of around 100 mm. Savannah climate: Savannahs are a type of grassland ecosystem characterized by the presence of a mix of trees and shrubs. The vegetation in savannahs is characterized mainly by grasses, which are found in the savannah's open spaces. The savannah has a relatively dry season with average annual temperatures of around 10 degrees Celsius.
