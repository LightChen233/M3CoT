[Choices] (A) It is a warm afternoon in Spain (B) It is a cool moring in the US (C) It is a cool moring in Canada (D) It is a hot day in Egypt Answer: (A, B, C) The image shows a woman standing in front of a display of donuts, which are displayed in a glass case. The woman is wearing a hat and apron, and she appears to be selling donuts. The time and location can be inferred based on these observations. The warm afternoon suggests that the weather is likely pleasant, and the display of the donuts suggests that it is a popular time for people to visit the market. The cool morning suggests that there might be a slight chill in the air, which could be a factor that attracts people to the market for a morning snack. The choice of a cool morning for the market could be due to the fact that it might be less crowded or less crowded during the day, which might make it easier for the woman to sell her donuts."]}
