Find the number of subsets of this set of chairs that contain at least three chairs.\n\nAnswer: There are 10 chairs in a circle, and to form a subset containing at least three chairs, we need to choose three chairs from the circle. Since there are 10 chairs, we can choose any three chairs, which means there are 10C3 = 120 subsets containing at least three chairs.\n\nChoice: C\n\n1. Five chairs are arranged in a circle. Find the number of subsets of this set of chairs that contain at least three chairs.\n\nAnswer: There are 5 chairs in a circle, and to form a subset containing at least three chairs, we need to choose three chairs from the circle. Since there are 5 chairs, we can choose any three chairs, which means there are 5C3 = 10 subsets containing at least three chairs.\n\nChoice: C\n\n1. Three chairs are arranged in a circle. Find the number of subsets of this set of chairs that contain at least three chairs.\n\nAnswer: There are 3 chairs in a circle, and to form a subset containing at least three chairs, we need to choose three chairs from the circle. Since there are 3 chairs, we can choose any three chairs, which means there are 3C3 = 1 subset containing at least three chairs.\n\nChoice: B\n\nIn conclusion, option C is the correct choice for the first two questions, but option B is the correct choice for the third question.

The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nLet's use the first triangle, with a base of 20 meters and a height of 15 meters. The hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, which is the side opposite the base. In this case, the hypotenuse is the height, 15 meters.\n\nNow, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n15^2 = 20^2 + 15^2\n\nSolving for the width of the river, we get:\n15^2 = 20^2 + 15^2\n15^2 = 400 + 225\n15^2 = 625\n\nTaking the square root of 625, we get:\n√625 = 25 meters\n\nSo, the width of the river is 25 meters.
