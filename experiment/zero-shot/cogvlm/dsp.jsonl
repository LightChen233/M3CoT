In this case, there are three points on the surface: Point A (X:0.9 Y:3.0), Point B (X:0.9 Y:-0.4), and Point C (X:2.5 Y:-0.4). From the contours, it can be seen that the heights at these three locations vary significantly. Specifically, from left to right, the heights increase as follows: -0.4m, 3.0m, 3.0m; -0.4m, 3.0m, 0.9m.
