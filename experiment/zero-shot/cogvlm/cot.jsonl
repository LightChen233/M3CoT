Since both magnets are made of the same material and there is no other external factor affecting their interaction, this can lead to some interesting phenomena:\n- When two similar magnets with opposing poles come close together, they will attract each other due to the magnetic field created by these polarities. However, if you place two different types or sizes of magnets next to each other, it may be difficult to determine which pair has more strength because the size and shape of the magnets also influence the magnitude of the magnetic field.\nIn summary, in Pair 1, the magnetic forces between the two magnets are not very strong since they are identical and interact with each other directly.
